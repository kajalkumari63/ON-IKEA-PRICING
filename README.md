In this project, I will do exploratory data analysis and Linear Regression by modelling different IKEA Product Prices. IKEA is a significant domestic and foreign retailer of furniture and household goods. IKEA is special among home goods retailers in its distribution of a yearly list of costs ensured to hold for 1 year. The study explores various factors that contribute to the pricing of IKEA products, such as sellable online, old prices, selling price, Category, Height, width, and depth of the product. The dataset can be used to study how consumer behaviour changes in response to the availability of products online and offline and the availability of products in different colours.
The approach we will use in this Analysis is as follows:
1. Import useful Python libraries.
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the data.
3. Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Ridge, Lasso, Net Elastic and Random Forest.
4. Correlation.
